# Flow

This is a fork of [Flow](https://flow-project.github.io/), a computational framework for deep RL and control experiments for traffic microsimulation.
This fork is used to support the paper XXXXXX.

To run the experiments used to generate the paper, follow the instructions to set-up Flow and then run the script 
`./scripts/run_bottleneck_exps.sh` to launch a set of AWS scripts. 

Alternately, you can generate all the graphs from the paper and process them by running XXXX.
