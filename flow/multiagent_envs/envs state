# super simple env
- rl abs position
- time since rl stopped
- congest number (nb of vehs on edge 4)

# simple env
- states from super simple env
- duration (?)
- rl speed
- leader speed 
- rl headway
- aggregate_statistics (IF aggregate_info) #new

# complex env
- rl veh_statistics
- rl state_util
- rl get_signal (IF communicate)
- aggregate_statistics (IF aggregate_info)



# veh_statistics(rl_id)
- rl speed
- rl edge
- rl lane
- rl headway
- rl position on edge
- rl absolute position 
- time counter
- time since stopped

# state_util(rl_id)
- headway
- tailway
- leader speed
- follower speed
- leader is rl?
- follower is rl?
all that for each lane, filled with -1 if not enough (but only filled at end?)

# aggregate_statistics()
- time step
- outflow over last 10 seconds (always 0 with reroute)
- number of vehicles in congested area (edge 4)
- average velocities of edges 3, 4, 5
